# MSTU 5003 Midterm Design Document
This is a design document for a website that is dedicated for teaching music instrument online. The goal of this document is to introduce the intended purpose, benefits, and audience of the website. It also includes further analysis of potential users with user stories. Furthermore, it incorporates strategy, objective, and success masurement. Last but not least, content specifications, information architecture, and navigation design will be discussed in detail.

## Topic
The topic of this website is to self-learn how to play violin. The goal is that the users will be able to play their favorite piece of music after they start using the website. Since we don't expect 100% of our audience to have music background, we do provide information and resources that can help our audience to start learning as soon as possible. These information and resources will be given to the users after certain assessment process. Most importantly, the website provides a very interactive interface that help beginners to understand how to operate the music instrument. In addition, the website offers different versions of the same music so that the users can have sense of accomplishment and see themselves getting closer to be able to play the music they like.

## Problem
Many people believe that it is difficult to learn music as adults. Some adults might not have the time to learn or are just too embarrassed to take a music class in person. However, there has not been an easy solution for this. Many existing violin learning websites only contain articles (text) on how to play the instrument but miss a lot of information on other aspects such as reading music, stance, hand poses, and tempo. Users are often overwhelmed by the flood of information and can't really transfer the knowledge from text to action. These websites typically don't have user profiles to help users track their progress. We hope to solve these problems by providing the users something different.

However, there are some problems that we can not solve. As of today, we can not help students to have better stance or gestures.

## Target Audience
This website is for adults who are interested in learning violin but either are new or only have some limited knowledge of playing violin. The target audience have high interests in classical music. And they are typically the same group who go to classical music concerts. They are familiar with some famous symphonies and composers. Now they are looking forward to take another step in the classical music world, playing the music themselves. And it's very likly that they come to the website with a list of music in mind that they want to to able to play in the future.

Our assumption is that the majority of the early adptors are between the age of **35-55** with college degree or up (Princeton University Research). Most of them live in urban areas. Even though most of them are well-educated, they are typically not the best technology users. Therefore, we believe that feasibility, engagement, and early satisfaction establishment are critical for customer retention.

What they know: We expect the users know what a violin is and where to buy one. And some of them might know how to read music notes. We also expect them to have some background knowledge about classical music.

What they don't know: We don't expect them to know how to hold a violin, even though they might have seen how other people hold it. Also, we don't expect them to know how the terminologies for all the violin parts.
Some of them might not know how to read music. And we believe that these are all the gaps we have to fill before we get to play any musics. We do understand that there are users who had played violin before and now decide to come back. These users might not have all the gaps. But this will be determined in a pre-assessment phase. The goal is to communicate with the users and understand what the users really need in terms of learning.

### User Stories
**Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.**

 **User Story 1:** As [a classical music enthusiast who have intersts in playing the instrument myself], I want to [learn from playing the music I'm familiar with] so that [eventually I can play the full piece].

They are the main target audience for the website. We can reach them by handing out fliers around concert halls. They can also search us on search engines. They will be amazed by how easy it is for them to learn violin on the website. Unlike many other websites, our website can actually keep track of their learning progress. So everytime they come back, they can start whereever they were at last time. Also, there might be a community forum that connects the users with each other. We believe this would be sufficient to create user retention.

**User Story 2:** As [someone who is very new to any music instruments], I want to [learn how to read the notes] so that [I can play the sheet music].

This type of user might be a large sub-group of the previous user type. This user type needs extra information to get started. They are the people who would quit right away if they think what the website is providing is going to be too hard for them. Therefore, it's important to let them know at the moment when they see the website that the lessons are not going to be difficult. This is also one of the reasons that the website is called Easy Violin and have some text to emphasize how easy it is going to be. For example, in the first page there is a block of text saying "learn how to play violin in 7 days". We also provide a visual sample of how everything is going to look like. In addition to all the egagement elements in the first page, we also make the actual learning process really easy. There is a way to start playing without fully understand how to read sheet music. The users will be able to

**User Story 3:** As [someone who is returning to violin after years away from the instrument], I want to [be able to skip the boring introduction materials but go back to them when I need them] so that [I can stay engaged and save some time].

This type is more advanced than the previous type. But they behave in an opposite way. They don't want to wait 3 years to play the song they played at middle school. They want to to customize their own journey and skip the things they already know. For them, this is the part that will get their attention. And if we are able to achieve customization, we expect this type of users would be more likely to return.
