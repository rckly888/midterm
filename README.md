# MSTU 5003 Midterm Design Document
This is a design document for a website that is dedicated for teaching music instrument online. The goal of this document is to introduce the intended purpose, benefits, and audience of the website. It also includes further analysis of potential users with user stories. Furthermore, it incorporates strategy, objective, and success masurement. Last but not least, content specifications, information architecture, and navigation design will be discussed in detail.

## Topic
*What is the subject at hand?*
*Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?*

## Problem
*What is the problem you're trying to solve?*

## Target Audience
This website is for adults who are interested in learning violin but either are new or only have some limited knowledge of playing violin. The target audience have high interests in classical music. And they are typically the same group who go to classical music concerts. They are familiar with some famous symphonies and composers. Now they are looking forward to take another step in the classical music world, playing the music themselves. And it's very likly that they come to the website with a list of music in mind that they want to to able to play in the future.

Our assumption is that the majority of the early adptors are between the age of **35-65** with college degree or up. Most of them live in urban areas. Even though most of them are well-educated, they are typically not the best technology users. Therefore, we believe that feasibility, engagement, and early satisfaction establishment are critical for customer retention.

### User Stories
**Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.**

Structure your user stories as features, so you can actually build it to meet the users needs.

**Example**: As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Keep these questions in mind:
- Who are you building the feature for? What type of user?
- What are you building and what will it accomplish?
- What kind of engagement and value will the feature/website bring for the user? What does it accomplish?

- **User Story 1:** One user can be someone who is returning to violin after years away from the instrument
- **User Story 2:**ANother user can be someone who knows how to play by ear but wants to learn the notes.
- **User Story 3:**
- **User Story 4:**
